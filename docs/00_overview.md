# Mid-Level Data Engineer Assessment (Local Only)

This assessment tests your ability to ingest, transform, model, and visualize data using a **local-only toolchain**:

- Python (3.10+)
- DuckDB
- Parquet & Delta (local lake)
- dbt-duckdb
- Power BI Desktop

You will build a mini data warehouse for a fictional retailer from scratch, with realistic raw data sources.

**What we test:**
- Python ingestion, schema enforcement, and partitioned writes
- Delta Lake ACID features and time travel
- dbt modeling, tests, incremental logic, and snapshots
- Dimensional modeling (facts, SCD2 dims)
- BI design in Power BI
- Data quality, resilience, and professionalism

---

## Deliverables
- `/scripts/generate_data.py`
- `/scripts/load_to_bronze.py`
- `/dbt` project with models, tests, snapshots
- `/duckdb/warehouse.duckdb`
- `/lake` with Bronze/Silver/Gold Parquet & Delta
- `/analytics/report.pbix`
- Short post-mortem write-up

---

## How to use these docs

Follow the documents in order. Each doc focuses on one exercise that builds on the previous step. A suggested flow:

- Read `00_overview.md` to align on goals and deliverables.
- Implement `02_data_generation.md` to create realistic raw files under `data_raw/`.
- Implement `03_bronze_ingestion.md` to move raw files into `lake/bronze`.
- Complete `04_dbt_silver.md` and `05_gold_model.md` to build the warehouse layers.
- Finish `06_powerbi.md` and `07_reliability_ops.md` for reporting and operational checks.

Tip: keep each step runnable at a small scale (e.g., 1% of target rows) so you can iterate quickly. Include a README section in your submission that states how to run each step and how long it takes at the sample scale.

## Minimal repo layout expectations

The grader will expect the following locations to exist (relative to repo root):

- `data_raw/` — files generated by `generate_data.py`
- `lake/bronze/parquet/` and `lake/bronze/delta/` — outputs from `load_to_bronze.py`
- `duckdb/warehouse.duckdb` — optional DuckDB manifest / views used by dbt
- `dbt/` — dbt project with `models/`, `snapshots/`, and `tests/`

If a directory is intentionally empty, include a short `README.md` or `.gitkeep` so the intended structure is visible.
